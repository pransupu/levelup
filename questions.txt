1) Write code to check a String is palindrome or not? (solution)
A palindrome is those String whose reverse is equal to the original. This can be done by using either StringBuffer reverse() method or by technique demonstrated in the solution here.


2) Write a method which will remove any given character from a String? (solution)
hint: you can remove a given character from String by converting it into a character array and then using substring() method for removing them from output string.

8) How to convert numeric String to int in Java? (solution)


Some more String related Questions which mostly appear in Java programming interviews:

1) What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in Java? (answer)
The main difference is that String is immutable but both StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable. Also, StringBuilder is not synchronized like StringBuffer and that's why faster and should be used for temporary String manipulation.


2) Why String is final in Java? (answer)
The string is final because of same reason it is immutable. Couple of reasons which I think make sense is an implementation of String pool, Security, and Performance. Java designers know that String will be used heavily in every single Java program, so they optimized it from the start.

3) How to Split String in Java? (answer)
Java API provides several convenient methods to split a string based upon any delimiter e.g. comma, semicolon or colon. You can even use a regular expression to split a big string into several smaller strings.

4) Why Char array is preferred over String for storing password? (answer)

9) In an array 1-100 numbers are stored, one number is missing how do you find it? (solution)


10) In an array 1-100 exactly one number is duplicate how do you find it? (solution)


11) In an array 1-100 multiple numbers are duplicates, how do you find it? (solution)
One trick in this programming questions is by using HashMap or Hashtable, we can store a number as key and its occurrence as value if the number is already present in Hashtable then increment its value or insert value as 1 and later on print all those numbers whose values are more than one.


12) Given two arrays, 1,2,3,4,5 and 2,3,1,0,5 find which number is not present in the second array.
Here is a quick tip to solve this programming question: put the elements of the second array in the Hashtable and for every element of the first array, check whether itâ€™s present in the hash or not, O/P all those elements from the first array that are not present in the hash table


13) How do you find the second highest number in an integer array? (solution)


14) How to find all pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to the given number? (solution)


15) How to remove duplicate elements from the array in Java? (solution)


16) How to find the largest and smallest number in an array? (solution)


17) How to find the top two maximum number in an array? (solution)


14) How do you find middle element of a linked list in a single pass?
To answer this programming question I would say you start with a simple solution on which you traverse the LinkedList until you find the tail of linked list where it points to null to find the length of the linked list and then reiterating till middle.


15) How do you find the 3rd element from last in a single pass? (solution)
This programming question is similar to above and can be solved by using 2 pointers, start the second pointer when the first pointer reaches third place.


16) How do you find if there is any loop in a singly linked list? How do you find the start of the loop? (solution)
This programming question can also be solved using 2 pointers and if you increase one pointer one step at a time and other as two steps at a time they will meet in some point if there is a loop.

You can check this Java program to print Fibonacci Series using recursion and iteration.


31) How to check if a number is binary? (solution)
For this question, you need to write a function which will accept an integer and return true if it contains only 0 and 1 e.g. if the input is 123 then your function will return false, for 101 it should return true.
